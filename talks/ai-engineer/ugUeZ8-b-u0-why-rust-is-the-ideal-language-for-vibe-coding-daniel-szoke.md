## Description

TypeScript is easy for models to write because it imposes few constraints. Those same missing constraints let models introduce data races that compile, run, and only fail intermittently. A thread safety bug in Rust does not compile. The compiler names the unsound type, explains why it cannot be sent between threads, and points the agent directly at the fix.

Daniel Szoke, Rust SDK maintainer at Sentry, argues that optimizing for a language models can write easily is the wrong goal. The better optimization is a language whose compiler enforces correctness as a natural feedback loop. Every error an agent hits and resolves in a loop is a production bug that never ships. The Rust compiler is also faster than asking a review agent to find the same class of bugs and more reliable than hoping it does.

**[0:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=14s)** My name is Daniel Zook. I'm uh the Rust SDK maintainer at Sentry and I want to tell you why I think Rust is the ideal language for vibe coding. So, the conventional wisdom on what language to use for agentic coding or vibe coding, however you refer to it, um it's Rust is probably not one of the first things you think of. Um You know, maybe you think you know, probably chat GPT has a good idea, what's the best agentic coding language given that it's also a an agent of some sort. And it would tell you that there's no single number one language, um but that Python is probably the top language, um and as a strong number two,

**[1:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=63s)** it said JavaScript and TypeScript when I asked it. Um and I think that this is in, at least my experience, pretty true, although I would flip the order because um TypeScript seems to have come out as like the top choice for agentic coding lately. And um so there's even this article from GitHub that came out uh I guess late last year and it says that AI, like they think that AI has pushed TypeScript to the number one um language on GitHub by contributor counts at least. Um so they know it's TypeScript is the number one language and they they strongly suspect that that's because of people using it for AI-assisted

**[1:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=111s)** development. But why are these languages Python, TypeScript, JavaScript so ideal for vibe coding. Um at least to in the this sort of conventional wisdom. So, first of all, they're common and familiar languages. Um So, they're they're they're usually the languages you would learn if you were learning programming from scratch. So, they're easy for humans, and they also seem to be easy for LLMs. There's also a lot of frameworks, libraries, and examples out there. Um so, that that's helpful if you're building something new from scratch, of course, that you can build it on top of something. And you know, it's helpful for humans, it's also helpful for agents.

**[2:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=160s)** They're fast to scaffold and run. They're dynamic languages. They're interpreted, at least JavaScript and Python are. TypeScript, maybe there's some light compilation down to JavaScript or something, but it's pretty easy just to run it and see what it does, and then you iterate on that. And uh particularly for agents, the typing support is helpful so that the agent doesn't misuse types. Um but uh yeah, there's the any type that it kind of undermines that a little bit in in TypeScript and and typed Python, but you know, overall, these languages, LLMs, the models themselves are pretty good at outputting runnable code in the first try because these languages

**[3:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=209s)** are simple, um and they impose few constraints. So, I think because of this fact that LLMs just seem to be good at writing them, people jump to these languages. Um but I think something that a lot of people in my experience don't question as much as whether this is even something we want to optimize for, right? Um the classic vibe coding languages are easy for the models to write, but is that even a good thing? My argument is that the importance of it being easy for the model to write the language is overstated. In fact, I would even say that in some cases it's a bad thing that these languages are easy for the models

**[4:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=260s)** to write. Um the dynamic and flexible nature of the languages is what makes it easy for the agent or for the LLM, I should say, to write JavaScript, Python, TypeScript. Um but this same flexibility also makes it very easy to make mistakes. Sometimes even obvious mistakes, sometimes less obvious mistakes. Adding typing is a helpful constraint, but that only gets you so far um because it only gives you the type safety and also it's not a very strong type safety um in TypeScript or Python. And this is of course a problem because LLMs are fallible. They will always be fallible because they're by design

**[5:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=307s)** non-deterministic systems. So, hopefully in the future they get better at making mistakes less often, but I don't think this is something that would ever disappear entirely. And so, just like the smartest humans make mistakes and we need to guard against human error, we're also going to need to guard against LLM error. One way that folks often would do that, especially also in the conventional uh vibe coding languages, is adding tests. This is a huge help, but there are a lot of problems with only relying on having tests and and code review agents. Um firstly, you know, if you don't prompt the agent skillfully, it'll often write

**[5:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=357s)** the tests after the implementation and then you just end up testing implementation details without actually testing the behavior properly. Uh even with that test-driven development though, tests usually can only prove incorrectness when they fail because it's impractical call to test every single possible input combination. You can't prove that every input produces the correct output in a lot of cases. And then of course, if LLMs are the ones generating the tests, they may make mistakes when writing those tests and the same thing applies to coding review agents. And then kind of more on a philosophical level, right? We all know

**[6:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=404s)** AI stands for artificial intelligence, but there's this book called Nexus I recently read and I can highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it yet. It's from an author Yuval Noah Harari. He's a historian and he has kind of a unique perspective on artificial intelligence. So he's discussing human information networks all the way from Stone Ages to printing press to internet to now with LLMs, right? Um and he thinks LLMs are really unique because it's the first time we have something that's non-human that's able to produce human language. And um a point he makes that really stuck with me is that he doesn't like that

**[7:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=452s)** the A in AI is artificial because it understates how different um LLMs and other AI technologies are from how humans think and he actually likes to call it alien intelligence instead. Um because the internal workings of how they think at a low level is different from how we think. LLMs predict tokens that come in streams and it's a very powerful mechanism of thinking, but it's not how we think. And my point here is that the failure modes might be totally unexpected to us. And I'm sure if you've done any coding with AI, you might have had a situation where you got code that looked really nice. It might have had sensible variable names, good comments,

**[8:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=501s)** and whatever. But when you take a look, something might not be right. Like there might be a subtle bug or maybe it's relying on some heuristic when you could check the actual thing and more reliably and more easily in some cases. So, you really need to be careful with this with um LLM and agent tech-based development, right? And then that brings me to Murphy's Law, which basically states that anything that can go wrong will go wrong eventually at some point, right? So, if you are using a language without deterministic guardrails, even if you apply human review, uh agentic review, test a good testing process, if you don't have something that is a

**[9:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=549s)** absolute deterministic guard against this, eventually you're going to have some failures. And in these languages like JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, where you lack these guardrails a lot of the times, you're going to have failures more often, right? Um and this brings me to Rust, which is a language with many constraints. Um and so for those of you who don't know anything about Rust or don't know that much about it, some basic background. It's a compiled language. It's designed with safety and performance in mind. It wants to be as fast as C and C++, but it wants to be memory safe, type safe, um and basically wants to be such like it

**[9:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=598s)** wants to have such a strict compiler that if the code compiles, you can be reasonably confident that a lot of different types of bugs are not present in your code. Um and that that happens because the compiler is enforcing invariants like type safety, memory safety, concurrency, et cetera. Um and the language tries to be very beginner-friendly. So, Rust itself, I think people who haven't encountered it would kind of have the perception that it's very advanced, but they try to make the language easy to learn. The compiler errors give you a lot of information on what went wrong and how to fix the problem. And so, they provide a lot of context, and of course, this is really helpful when AI agents compile Rust code, hit an

**[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=648s)** error, and then need to fix it. So, as I mentioned, there's a lot of safety guarantees in Rust, right? Um first one worth mentioning is that the type safety is is strict. You can't bypass it with some any type or an unchecked cast. Null safety is another big one if you've come from other languages. There's no universal null value. If you want to have an option that or an a type that can be empty, you need to define it explicitly as an option type, and the compiler will force you to always check that the value is there before you access the inner value. And fearless concurrency, which is, I think, really powerful and it

**[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=696s)** basically means that the Rust compiler will check if you have a any multi-threaded code that any data shared between the threads is done that that's all done in a thread-safe way. And this is really just a small list. There's there's so many more things that the Rust compiler enforces, but I just want to give you all a quick example on fearless concurrency because I think it's it's really powerful. So, here's a little code example. Basically, we have a counter here, which is going to start with a value of zero, and we're going to create 100 threads here. Um And each time we're going to take the counter and add one to this inner value.

**[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=746s)** So, once all these threads finish, you would expect this to have a value of 100. Now, there's a problem here, which is that um these types here, they're designed for um sharing mutable data, but only within a single thread. They're not synchronized for um multi-threaded safe access. Um so, in a language like TypeScript, something like this might compile, it might run, and then you would only notice the problem when every once in a while you would get a value other than 100 out of this, right? And it might be, especially if this is a small part in a bigger application, it could be very difficult to debug where this data race is occurring.

**[13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=797s)** But in Rust, this just doesn't compile. You're going to get a compile error, and it will say, "Error: Future cannot be sent between threads safely. Um this future, so this little async block in here, um is not send. And all send means is safe to be sent between threads, and it's not. So this error isn't that helpful, but if you scroll down in the error message, it'll explain further. And this is what's going to be really helpful to your AI agent because it says, "Oh, the value here, this counter value that was captured, it's not send. It has type RC RefCell i32, and that's not send." And so if your AI agent, when it just

**[14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=847s)** compiles your project, it'll get this compiler error, and it can immediately go and change this to a thread-safe type, of which there's there's plenty in in Rust. Um so of course, all these uh constraints come with a trade-off. Rust is harder for LLMs to get right on the first try because there's so many rules they need to follow. But I think this is a good thing. Um that's because it's not just LLMs that write code. We put the LLM in an AI agent. It's in a loop. It can do things autonomously. And AI agents are very well suited to be able to compile their code, check any failures, and then go and fix them.

**[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=896s)** And every compile error um is potentially a bug that you avoid in your production code. So um and and with the Rust compiler, like something I hear sometimes people complain that compile times are slow. But I guarantee you that it's faster than letting an AI agent review your code, and it might not even find all the errors that the Rust compiler is guaranteed to find. I still think you should use use it, of course, but it's good to have this um additional element of safety, I guess. And of course, this is a sponsored talk and I'm from Sentry, so this is the little marketing slide. Um

**[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUeZ8-b-u0&t=944s)** you should try us out if you don't already. This QR code would give you 3 months for free of our business plan. Um we have agent monitoring features. We have a booth downstairs. Come by. Feel free to ask questions about Sentry or if you want to talk to me about the talk, you can also come by and I'm happy to chat. Thank you.
