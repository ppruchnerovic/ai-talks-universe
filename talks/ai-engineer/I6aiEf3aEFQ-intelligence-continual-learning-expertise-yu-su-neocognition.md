## Description

Scheduling a meeting is not finding a shared slot on everyone's calendar. It is a constraint optimization over authority, priority, and urgency, and an expert sees that immediately where a very capable model does not. Yu Su uses examples like that one to separate two things the field keeps collapsing together. Intelligence is reasoning through an unfamiliar problem from the context you were handed, which frontier models keep getting better at and where each episode stands alone. Expertise is accumulated, situated competence, and almost nobody is scaling it.

His account of why coding agents work while everything else stays brittle is a modern Moravec's paradox. Code is already a language native world, symbolic and structured, with tests standing in for rewards. The rest of digital work is millions of micro worlds, each with its own local physics, far too heterogeneous for one static model to compress. The slide he calls the most important plots raw intelligence against expertise and finds them roughly orthogonal: scale intelligence alone and you get what he calls the world's smartest novice, brilliant at whatever is put in front of it and accumulating nothing between problems. Intelligence expands the search, spinning up a hundred parallel attempts. Expertise compresses it, because the shortcuts are already learned. The provocation he leaves is unbounded expertise from bounded intelligence: if continual learning gets good enough past some threshold of raw capability, the thing worth scaling stops being the model.

**[0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=1s)** [music] >> All right. I understand that I'm standing between you and the lunch, so I'll try to be quick. My name is Isu. I'm a professor at The Ohio State, The Ohio State, and I also have another job, which is COO at a company called The Neo Cognition, and we focus on agents and continual learning. So, today's talk, it won't be too technical, but I would it will be mainly a conceptual one. But, I think it's a very important conceptual distinction that I will try to make between what is intelligence and what is expertise. And through this, I will try

**[0:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=51s)** to answer some of the very bothering questions for me that um like why we are so successful at the coding agents, but they're so terrible at anything else, right? Why uh the current agents are so token inefficient uh like to the degree that every company right now is like coming out and try to curb their uh their token mixing efforts in the company. Um so hopefully this will provide some food for thoughts before lunch. Right, first a bit of a history. Um so, AI agents are not a new thing, right? It's uh we have been trying to develop agents throughout the whole history of AI. Um but, the problem is that in the early stages, uh let's say

**[1:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=100s)** um in the night in the 1960s to uh '80s, when we developed these expert systems or logical agents, or like in the uh 2010s, when we developed these deep RL-based uh neural agents, we were only able to capture some very limited facets of human intelligence, right? Whether it's like logical reasoning or it's like uh perception in single modalities to decision. Um only recently with the multi-modal LLMs and the language agent built on top of them, for the first time, we have a neural model that is able to encode multi-sensory inputs into a uh unified neural representation that is also conducive to symbolic reasoning and communication,

**[2:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=149s)** right? So, that was a trait uh unique to humans. Now, uh AI agents finally have the same thing. So, that drastically uh improve their expressiveness, their reasonability, and adaptivity. So, that's why I think we have really entered a new evolutionary stage of machine intelligence. And uh it didn't take long for these language agents to find their first mass markets, which is coding. And the best way to illustrate this is probably through the uh revenue graph of Anthropic's, right? In just under 2 years, their revenue has grown 400 times uh to uh 40 billion. I think the newest number is maybe 60 billion uh annualized runway. And it's largely driven by

**[3:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=198s)** coding and coding-related productivity uh capabilities. But if we think about it, right? Coding is the really the ideal market for these language agents because code is already a language-native world. Everything is already represented symbolically and like uh recorded uh in a very structured way. And you get your rewards, you get your uh like tests all in place in symbolic ways. So, then what happens when we leave the privileged world of codes? Well, not so well. Um we are running into a lot of challenges deploying these agents in enterprise settings. And the uh also in personal settings

**[4:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=247s)** that the uh like open class uh constantly make this uh like uh quite brittle and silly errors. And then to the extent that the Andrew Ng said that it's not going to be the year of agents, it's going to be the decade of agents because they they cannot do computer use, they don't have continual learning. Um I don't know how much Andrew Ng's uh thought has changed uh since like last time because of the coding agent and everything, but I think the difficulties with computer use with continual learning still largely the same right now. So how can something be so small but also so brittle at the same time? Here's my thesis around it. I think we are actually witnessing a modern version

**[4:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=294s)** of the Moravec's paradox. Right? So the uh Moravec's paradox essentially states that uh uh for AI, uh hard things are easy, easy things are hard. So the modern version here is that we are very good at these symbolic reasoning tasks like coding and math, which were considered crown jewel of uh of intelligence uh earlier. But then we still struggle with this everyday digital work because they really require quite different set of cognitive competencies to excel at them. And more specifically, I think modern society is really not just one unified world. It's millions of these micro worlds. Like every domain, every profession is different,

**[5:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=342s)** every company is different. Even if you're using the same software, every company a company configure it differently. So, it's extremely idiosyncratic, especially in the digital world. It has its unique local physics, like different structures constraints affordances and dynamics that you have to learn. It's just like too heterogeneous and dynamic for any monolithic model to try to compress it into one static representation. So, agents must continually learn on the job to acquire what I call specialized expertise for each specific microworld. The second part of the talk, I will try to establish the differences between intelligence and expertise.

**[6:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=391s)** Here are the working definitions. For intelligence, it's the capacity to reason through unfamiliar problems from available context. Right? This is what the frontier models are increasingly good at. Um you give it the problem statement, the context, the tools, and it can reason through this even if it's a scene done for the first time, uh and it can do a great job. Every episode is more or less independent from each other here. But expertise is different. Expertise is really accumulated and situated competence. It's the ability to act reliably, efficiently, and with judgment to achieve reproduce pretty super real performance in a particular domain.

**[7:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=439s)** Right? So, this is in stark contrast with intelligence. And to uh show what does ex- expertise actually contain, I think uh the key idea from cognitive science is that experts don't just know more facts. They actually see the world differently. Right? So, um the uh expertise allows you to do different pattern recognition. So, you see through the specific patterns. Like, if you're looking an expert is looking at like a gigantic bug report, they can immediately locate like the most plausible places where things could go wrong. Um and they think about the problem with like a very deep structure, right? When

**[8:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=487s)** you are scheduling a meeting, you know that it's not just like finding the shared slot on everyone's calendar is actually a constraint optimization problem over everyone's authority, the priorities, the urgency, and everything. Um and we don't experts don't just operate with a set of rules, a set of facts. We know that every single thing is conditional. Right? Every rule has like the preconditions where it applies, but then we also know when we can bend the reality, we can bend the rules when exceptions happen. Right? And finally, that also give us judgment and taste. It's importantly what's like high quality and uh very importantly when to stop, when it's good enough. Um so, all these together, I think

**[8:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=537s)** experts effectively has have built a world model of their environments. Right? That it's a generalized notion of world model that captures how that microworld works, and that becomes the basis for all of our perception, uh reasoning, decision-making, uh and judgment. So, intelligence and expertise are really quite different across many dimensions, uh but some of the impor- interesting ones here are like intelligence is about, "Hey, when we have the context, uh how to solve the problem through the context." But, expertise actually will bring you the the right context. Right, given any problem, we know what context bring into are important for this problem and bring

**[9:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=586s)** it in to solve the problem. And because of that, uh intelligence tend to expand our search. Like every problem solving is a search problem. So, intelligence tend to brute force it. Try to uh try to spin up like 100 different uh like uh parallel ways to to try to solve the problem. Well, expertise will actually try to compress the search space because expertise has constructed this has learned this essential shortcuts for the problem space. So, that whenever you have a problem, you know the most plausible ways to solve it. Um And then, I also think the final part here is that I think continual learning is the important bridge

**[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=635s)** from intelligence to expertise. But first, let me try to define continual learning because it's such a confusing term. Um and and Jack just uh gave some definition earlier. Uh it was like 10 different names. Um But here's my the definition I work with. I think continual learning is adaptive compression of experience into reusable structures for future behavior. So, all of these four elements here are very important. For experience, we need to uh answer the question like what kind of experience we're talking about. Is it more like episodes of experience or is like uh these semantic facts or procedures or feedback from human or in environments? And how do we compress that?

**[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=682s)** Uh so, in we embed them into vectors or we index them into some symbolic structure. Uh we uh distill them into model parameters or do some uh kind of a reinforcement learning. And it's not just like one-time compression. It needs to be adaptive compression. Like what do you have learned, what do you have compressed so far should uh largely uh influence how you compress further. And what kind of structure we're looking at? Is just like parameters like adapters of your uh language models or is vectors, graphs, or skills, or even word models? And then how do you use these reusable structures? Is like uh you use it just to recall these facts or you use it for prediction of like future states? You use it for uh for better planning, for or even for the control

**[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=732s)** like actuation layer of the agent, or as a value function for potential states. Right? So, it's because of this uh the continual learning problem is so rich, like it has these four different aspects, and if different aspects can be instantiated in different ways, that makes this field so confusing. But hopefully this is a definition that uh encompasses most of the uh versions of continual learning. Then, I think that uh this is maybe the most important figure in this talk. Um if we put it raw intelligence as the x-axis and uh expertise as the y-axis, I think we'll find that they are largely

**[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=779s)** orthogonal to each other. If you don't have continual learning, uh all you do is scaling your model to to get better like raw intelligence, then what we will get is what I call the world's smartest novice. Like super smart, it can try to uh try to attack at any problem uh provide given to it, but it doesn't accumulate expertise, so it end up as just like brute forcing its way at every problem. Then, if you have continual learning, uh like different continual learning algorithms will essentially set the slope of your learning uh curve here. All right, if you have a sloppy CL algorithm, maybe some kind of simple in-context learning, then uh with like uh increasing intelligence, then your

**[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=827s)** expertise will increase like a little bit. But, if you have a really strong uh continual learning algorithm, then uh the expertise will um increase like uh rapidly. Of course, this is assuming like a given time horizon and the experience horizon. And then, among all of these potential futures that uh good continual learning will bring us, I think this is prob- probably the the one I like the most or I think it is the most interesting, which I call the unbounded expertise from bounded intelligence. All right, what if we can uh come up with a continual learning algorithm such that um given up Once the raw intelligence has across a certain threshold,

**[14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=875s)** we don't need a stronger intelligence anymore. Like, continual learning will bring us like unbounded expertise once we have like a reasonable level of intelligence. All right, then we can call this the escape intelligence. And if this is indeed true, then it will have a lot of impli- uh implications for the whole ecosystem. All right, do we need to continually training to train these larger and larger models? Or like, these models like uh meet us uh maybe they're already good enough. What we're missing is just like better continual learning algorithms. So, the two To be a little bit more concrete, I think uh to provide more food for thought, uh here are some open questions I think uh in this space,

**[15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=923s)** the overarching question is like given any domain or environment, right? How can an agent continue to learn to specialize and reach expert-level competency? But to do that, you need to answer many other questions, right? How do you even measure, uh define and measure expertise? And this is probably uh environment-specific. And how to handle the trade-off between reliability and plasticity, right? Um we want these agents to be both reliable and plastic. But they are inherently conflicting with each other, right? Reliable systems or stable systems, they resist the change. But the plastic systems likes change. So, how do we reconcile that? Um

**[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=972s)** But fortunately, we do have a living existence proof, which is us ourselves, humans, uh that we are incredibly uh plastic, but also manage to be dependable most of the time. Um then uh from a technical perspective, like when we talk about learning, largely they are like this uh two forms of learning, parametric or non-parametric. So, how And my uh belief here is that both are really needed for uh this type of continual learning to to actually work. But how do we synergize the two? And finally, even though we are focusing on specialization, I think there is a great potential for specialization to actually generate to lead to like better

**[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=1020s)** generalization. You know, we all we have exhausted the public data for training LLMs, but the next stage of training, the next internet-scale data opportunity is actually in all of these different uh like private worlds. If we can make these specialized agent work, they can learn in situ and channel back the learning to the general model. Then that may be the next internet scale data opportunity. Okay, so finally a call to action. I think let's start scaling expertise. This will be a new dimension for us to scale because intelligence is already becoming abundance. The frontier models they are probably smarter than average humans.

**[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=1068s)** But expertise is still scarce. And we want to build a world where expertise becomes abundance where everyone can get expert support because in ideal world everyone can can have their personal health care, personal financial advisor, and personal tutors, and so on so forth. And then every company can build their their own learning loop. I think as Satya said two weeks ago like we want to enable this human AI learning loop at each company that turns into institutional memory and the full every company to build their own modes and to to still be in charge of their means of production.

**[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6aiEf3aEFQ&t=1118s)** And finally, I think with abundance of expertise we will actually see more types of work become possible because they are right now they are still a lot of opportunities that that are locked up because the friction is just so high to make them economically viable. But with abundance of expertise, I think that we will be able to lower the friction and make many of the new type of work across the threshold of worth doing. So this is the future we're building uh towards uh Neocognition and happy uh to share this with you and uh uh thanks for the attention. >> [applause] [music]
