**[0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1s)** INBAL SAGIV: Hi, everyone. My name is Inbal Sagiv, and I'm Principal Product Manager at Microsoft, working mainly on AI that runs locally. The session today is going to focus on extending Foundry Local for enterprise and disconnected environments. I'm going to walk you through some context from the market, then I'll speak through the AI offering, the model offering, the agent framework, and we'll close with some video agents. Let me start with the big picture. We're in a once-in-a-generation platform shift from applications to agentic AI as the operating layer. The data, as you see in that slide, is clear. We have 1.3 billion AI agents by 2028, which are automating end-to-end business processes.

**[0:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=54s)** We see 82 percentages of organizations adopting agents in the next three years, moving from pilots to core workforce. And we see additional numbers that coming from our analysts. Bottom line, the takeaway is pretty simple. The organizations that operation -- working today with some AI agent now need to move and define how the next decade of software is going to build and run. And everything is about agents and agentic capabilities. Now, let's see some of the scenarios that we hear from our customers because we want to ground everything that we ship with customer use cases.

**[1:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=103s)** These are not optional design choices. These are hard constraints geopolitical risks, regulatory control, the need to operate through outages, the growing pressure to adopt AI without giving up on sovereignty. The bottom line here is that customer says that AI strategy has to work when actually things are break. This is not just when everything is running smoothly on cloud. Now you see here multiple type of use cases and scenario, but let me just pick two items here. One of these are actually the public safety. When you are running a command center or responding to a crisis, there is no tolerance for latency,

**[2:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=153s)** for dependency, or for outages. AI needs to be operated fully disconnected while still delivering real-time situational awareness and decision support. No external calls, no data which has been sent to the cloud. If the network goes down, the system cannot goes down. We see it also from critical infrastructures like energy and utilities. These environments are distributed, often remote, and in these scenarios, connectivity is not guaranteed. Yet, they rely on AI for real-time monitoring, for diagnostics, and incident responses. If a substation or a rail system loses connectivity, operation does not. The AI must continue running locally safety

**[3:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=202s)** and with compliance. So when you step back, this is the shift. AI is no longer just about performance or scale, but it's actually about resilience and control, and the ability to operate under these constraints. The organizations solving for these now are those ones that will actually be able to deploy the AI everywhere it matters. If we look at the portfolio that Microsoft offers, when it comes to sovereign cloud, this allow the customers the freedom to choose the right balance of control, capability, and autonomy. Sovereign AI is about control, not just about the location itself. So, in the middle, you see "sovereign private cloud," which is a cloud environment, operated under full customer

**[4:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=255s)** or national control, where data and the models and the operations remain within a defined regulatory or geographic boundaries. It combines the cloud capabilities with an isolated and compliant infrastructure, Azure Local, that can operate independently, ensuring the continuity, the control, and the resilience even without external cloud connectivity, as I mentioned. Now, we're focusing on this context, before I'll dive into the entire AI offering, it's very important to understand what is Azure Local and why we actually run on that Azure Local infrastructure. So Azure Local is not new.

**[5:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=304s)** We're actually GA on both offering that is running on a connected and disconnected, fully disconnected sovereign use cases. And this is actually the foundation that makes the sovereign and enterprise AI possible on premises. It's not just a server. It's a proposed built-in AI-optimized infrastructure platform that designed to run the full Foundry Local stack. I'll speak through this in a minute. And when I refer to Foundry Local, I really refer from models to inferencing to agentic workflows entirely, where within the customer-own environment. Look at the hardware layer. So Azure Local delivers AI optimized hardware configuration that spanning across CPU, NPU, and GPU.

**[5:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=354s)** It's validated and certified to run a set of Foundry workloads out of the box. When you need a single-node inferencing or a lightweight model or a multi-node GPU cluster for high-performance generative AI, then the hardware is pre-validated so customers can deploy with a confidence and without lengthy qualification cycles. Now, actually, everything when we talk in the context of AI runs on Kubernetes native operation. The platform runs Arc-enabled Kubernetes, which means AI workloads are deployed and scaled and managed using the same declarative operator-based approach that IT teams already know for their containerized application.

**[6:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=404s)** And Foundry Local has been installed as an Arc extension. No custom orchestration or a proprietary tooling. If your team knows Kubernetes, they already know how to operate this one. I called out the connected and disconnected. It's very important. Azure Local is designed for the full spectrum of connectivity. In connected mode, it syncs model catalog and management policies from the cloud through Azure Arc. And in fully disconnected or air-gapped environment, the same infrastructure continues to operate autonomously. It means that models are cached locally and inference runs without any cloud dependency. And the operation teams actually retain the full control. Of course, it comes with a security and governance. So identity is handled through Microsoft Entra ID

**[7:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=453s)** with the JWT validation and inference endpoints are secured with a TLS and API key or token-based authentication. This is the same identity and governance layer that customers use across their cloud estate. But we're just extended it to on-premises AI without any compromises. So Azure Local is not just about the hardware, not just about the infrastructure. It's the AI ready platform that brings the Foundry capabilities from the cloud to the enterprise edge with a pre-validated hardware, with a Kubernetes native operation, as well as the security that I was calling out. Now, I mentioned Foundry. So everybody knows that Microsoft has the out-of-the-box offering

**[8:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=504s)** to build agent on cloud, on our public cloud. That's the Microsoft Foundry. And on the right side of the screen, we have our on-device inferencing offering. It's an SDK that optimized for Windows and Mac OS and Android. Now, what we're introducing today and announcing in a public preview is Foundry Local that runs on the infrastructure that I mentioned before, on Foundry Local for both connected and disconnected scenarios for single-node and multi-node across the different form factors of Azure Local. Now, today, we're happy to announce three capabilities when we say Foundry Local. On February this year,

**[9:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=551s)** we've already announced the availability of Foundry Local model catalog on a single-node deployment. That was good for those customers that has ONNX inferencing needs and single node is sufficient for them. But those that really needs to scale and run across multi-node now can benefit from Foundry Local model catalog, as well as inferencing capabilities. So that is one of our announcements. The second one is around knowledge. We're happy to refresh our RAG offering. That's a local RAG offering that helps you to manage your knowledge in the organization, and we will show you how it's going to look like in a minute. As well as some tools. Now what tools means.

**[9:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=599s)** It means that if you have a custom MCP, that you would like to connect it to your local sources, then now it's possible to do the mixture of choosing the right model using RAG capabilities and connect it through custom MCPs, and also other local tools that you might have. So the combination can come together, run on an Arc-enabled Kubernetes environment across the different form factors of Azure Local, from single-node to multi-node deployment. Which scenarios do we enable by that? So let's start to look at the models. From left to right, you see that there is now option to discover and deploy models. There is a catalog of models

**[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=648s)** which are curated for those scenarios. And there is also an option to bring your own model. So if you have a container with models that you choose from Hugging Face, let me pick an example. Let's say YOLO 10 or any predictive or generative AI, you can package this together and mix it, and merge it with your own OCI registry. And we provide you the option to serve these models, whether it's with a vLLM or with an ONNX Runtime. On the agent and tool size, we have now the option to connect to your local data with those MCPs that I mentioned. We bring you a reference application so you can build your local chat experience, and of course, it comes with an option also to build agents

**[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=699s)** that can run locally and connect with that entire platform offering. So today, we are announcing Foundry Local model offering. It means that we are expanding Foundry Local to include more community as well as proprietary models. And all these are validated and run on Azure Local for both connected and disconnected scenarios. Now, on the model platform offering, this is where the entire stack is being managed by the customers. This is where we bring the complete Foundry Local community models, the open source models, and making sure that these models can run through the different form factors or sizes of Azure Local from a single-node deployment to multi-node deployment.

**[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=749s)** And it comes with a pre-built inferencing capabilities, like ONNX Runtime for single node deployment and vLLM for multi-node deployment. And this one works for both connected and fully disconnected scenarios. The other option where we bring the customers the different Foundry Local model called model as a service. This is Microsoft-managed offering, but that's the approach for the customers really to get an access to their frontier models. We are working with Microsoft partners to bring the proprietary IP models, so think about the Mistral and OpenAI and others, to customers with the most sensitive workloads

**[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=800s)** where they cannot access the cloud. We're still partnering with some of these vendors, and there are specific eligibility criteria, so it's not available for everybody. Our customers are having some geopolitical and sovereign-driven model restrictions. So, for that purpose, we're shipping also the option of model as a service offering. This is driven, for example, by requesting EU only LLMs or geopolitical tension or regulatory pressure. Some customers has concern around foreign jurisdiction and external access and they prefer a long-term strategic autonomy, fully disconnected.

**[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=851s)** So this is the purpose of having a model as a service option for those customers. And both are valid. It means that -- at the end, there is a link if you're interested either in model as a platform or model as a service, just fill in the form, and you can get access and support from our product groups. Now, you see here how things are being structured together. So on the infra layer, we have Azure Local. On top of it, we have the Kubernetes clusters. Then there is the inference model, which could be ONNX for single node, vLLM, what we are announcing today, for multi-node deployment. And on top of it, we have some community model. You see here, just a partial list.

**[14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=898s)** We have 71 different models in the catalog. But a customer would need to choose if the approach to manage these models is through the platform itself or through the model as a service that allows also to get access to those frontier models that meets the eligibility criteria that I mentioned before. So, in order to do that, you see here, a screenshot from Azure Local with the option now to get Foundry Local, everything that I've described so far, so that the IT can now decide to deploy this and make it available for the developers. With that model offering that we are proposing today in preview, I'm explicitly calling out the inference layer support,

**[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=953s)** which is generative AI via ONNX Runtime for single-node deployment, plus vLLM for multi-node high-performance serving, plus predictive AI workloads through ONNX Runtime. So all models, whether it's from the Foundry catalog, from the partner providers, or from the customer own bring your own model, can run through one consistent runtime with an OpenAI-compatible REST endpoints. Key part of what we're actually enabling today is the breadth of model catalog. Customers are not locked into a single model strategy. They can choose across proprietary, open weight, and specialized models depending on the use case and the performance need and the regulation constraints.

**[16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1004s)** It means that using frontier models for reasoning or smaller efficient models for edge and disconnected environments is now possible. Customer can benefit from a domain-tuned model for specific workloads and all within the same platform. It results with flexibility without compromises on the right model, on the right place under full customer control. Now, let me walk you through some technical demo, so you can see how the things are coming up together. So that's just a screenshot from Microsoft Azure. And if we'll go here to "Settings," to "Extension,"

**[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1054s)** and I'll click on the plus, there is a new option: Foundry Local on Azure Local. So I'll click on creation of that extension. I will fill in the right configuration parameters, review, and create this. That's all I need to do as an IT in order to get it available on Azure Local. Now, let's see how things are coming up together. I'm not making assumption that developers works with interfaces. Sometimes they prefer to work with either SDK, CLI, or API. So everything that we're shipping is available through these different options. Now, here is an example of how we're doing the model deployment. It's from PowerShell.

**[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1103s)** So you see here that we're fetching the access token to be able to run those models. Here, what I see as part of the responses is the list of all the models which are available. Now I'm running another command in order to deploy one of the selected models. Let me just pause here and show you. I want to call it like gpt-oss-vllm. That's just a name that I want to put for the model. And in the body, I put here the model that I would like to run. In this case, it's gpt-opensource-20b. And I can also mention which inferencing I would like to use. And as a response, what actually happened here, you see here a POST request that says, "Oh, this one has been deployed." Now I want to do the same thing but with a Mistral model.

**[19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1152s)** So I'll just switch the body to Mistral 3b. And I'm running again a POST one. And as part of the response, this is actually the real deployment of these two selected models via a command line. Remember this, later on, I'm going to use it in my next demos. So, so far, we spoke about the model offering with the two options, and I showed you how it's going to -- how things are being available for the IP -- for the IT persona, as well as for the developer. Now look at the agent and tools with Foundry Local. So what you see here is the second part where we are enabling the developer also to build his own AI application with the deployed models. So in order to be able to do that,

**[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1201s)** we provide a solution templates. Think about it as a code samples which are available now in Microsoft Foundry solution templates. So we have two offerings there. One is a chat UI. It's really a standard chat experience end-to-end, that is -- can be connected to an agent. And this agent can be created by the developer. And as part of this agent, you can use the deployed model on that cluster. There is also video agent just to show another example of use cases where, for example, content from CCTV cameras can be analyzed through a product named Video Indexer that again runs on Azure Local. We also, on the knowledge side, we also enable the --

**[20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1252s)** in the extension to use the agentic RAG capability. It means that you can really manage your local knowledge with a local chat UI, which has been connected to a local RAG logic behind the scenes that now also, for the first time, can take action. This is one of the preview announcements that we are making today. And there is an option either to build your own custom MCP or simply to use one of the out-of-the-box MCPs that we have in the catalog. With time, one of the things that we are looking at you to come back to us is which MCPs do you need? Which local sources you are interested to connect to your local environment?

**[21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1301s)** And then we can expand the catalog based on the customer requirements and need as we go. So it's just a matter of allowing you to manage your knowledge through agentic RAG, reasoning, and grounding capabilities, as well as to be able to invoke some tooling and making some agentic flows that can run automatically. Now, here is just an example how things are being modeled together. So, at the top, you see the knowledge pipeline. When a user asks a question and then the agent first plans the query. It decides what to search for. Then it selects which knowledge sources to hit.

**[22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1350s)** And finally, it merge the result into a grounded answer. And here's the key part. This is iterative. I mean, you can run it in a couple of iterations. If the agent look at the results and decide doesn't have enough, then it loops back. It rewrites the queries. It expands the scope. It retrieves again. That's what makes it an agentic RAG. And it keeps going until it has a high confidence evidence, or it hits the configured effort limit. All of this runs locally. No cloud calls. Every response is traceable back to the source document. What you see in the bottom is that we have two options of sources of tools that we are allowing. Either it's indexed or it's a remote.

**[23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1402s)** There is an explicit call out here for SharePoint Exchange Server as well as Exchange Server. Both are part of Microsoft 365 Local that can run on Azure Local. So now we are partnering and testing our POC. So if you are interested in these scenarios, we are welcoming you to register and try out the POC that we've built specifically, with these two capabilities, where we can read the local data. Now, how things are actually working together. In the middle, you see here the chat, the local chat experience,

**[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1453s)** and the developer actually needs to build a local agent that can work with the deployed model, with the agentic RAG, and with those tools. So, in this case, I'm working with Mistral, and I just hit here a question. You see that there is an agent which has been -- which has been connected to that particular implementation. And it show here the sources. So it says SharePoint and Exchange are toggled on because it comes with a pre-configured capability to connect to a local data. And every response here show me also the source. Where did I fetch the information from? So that really enables customers to run local chat capabilities with the deployed model.

**[25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1504s)** You see it says here Ministral. We don't need that strong model in that particular scenarios. But the good thing is that you can really now work with a drop-down menu and just to switch this as you do in other local chat experiences. Last but not least, I just mention another offering that we have for video analysis. So you can go to Foundry solution template and for the first time download the code sample, also for video analysis, and try it out yourself. Just like we -- I showed you with the local chat experience, you can do it also with a video agent. That can serve multiple type of scenarios, mainly for live video analysis.

**[25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1556s)** If you want to learn more, there is a link here where you can register to our preview that covers everything that I showed you so far. And then you can decide if you want to try out only the model offering or you want to expand it and also try the RAG and the local chat experience. That's available for customers that runs on Kubernetes on Azure Local. There is a great blog post that explains both technicalities and code samples. So feel free to just click here and learn more and download the code sample, and try it yourself. And, of course, documentation is also available for you to learn about the different models that we offer and in

**[26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y7IIw6jlSM&t=1606s)** which scenarios to use what. In any chance that you would like to stay in touch, then feel free to reach out. We're looking at customers and developers that will give us feedback about the preview that we just announced today. And thank you so much for listening.
