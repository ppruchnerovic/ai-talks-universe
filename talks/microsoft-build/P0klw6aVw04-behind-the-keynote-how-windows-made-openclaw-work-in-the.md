**[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=0s)** Hi everybody. My name is Monica Cisneros and I am Senior Product Marketing Manager for Windows and I specialize on agents and today I have Scott Hanselman. Hi, how are you? Great. So today we saw you on the keynote and then you showed a conversation with Peter, basically, you know, him reaching out to you what tell us what happened? Like, how did that evolve? And what was your first impression with him, really, you know, asking you about what you had built? I think that people don't realize that like 99% of open source is community and it's just people talking about stuff and people who didn't. There are people who thought Peter was an overnight success

**[0:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=50s)** and he'd built 450 previous utilities that are amazing. He was a well known person in the open source space. He'd, you know, built and sold companies before. So for people who are unfamiliar with him, they might be like, oh, who's this guy? Where did he come from? But Open Claw when it came out in November of last year was like, oh, this is cool. I can see where he's going with this. And then I started looking around and I can see that he, he got, he has a Mac, He works on a Mac. So I'm like, oh, I work on Windows. I'll make a Mac. I'll make a Windows app that looks like the Mac App so I can participate as well. When someone sees something like that, it's a totally normal and reasonable thing to say. Hey, you, you want to hang out, you want to do something so it literally can that easy. So, you know, he reached out and he said this is cool, but all of the cool people that you're now seeing him surround himself with are people that he

**[1:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=99s)** found or that he respected or that he was doing work with. In the case of the the the Windows application, the Windows companion app, we were already as you know, because you work on Windows and doing agents building windows to be a great place for agents. So this might be a weird way to phrase it, but if you think about a Windows open clock companion app is like the ultimate hello world to prove that agents are awesome on Windows. So our job, your job, and my job is to make sure that the Windows platform, the underlayment, the base of the pyramid is awesome for any agent. And in this case, hello world open claw companion app is a proof of concept to see how Windows does. And as we learn more, we'll continue to make Windows better. So yeah, it's just sometimes people just go, hey, you want to do this thing?

**[2:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=147s)** Yeah, we should do that. That's cool. Let's do it. Let's come back to the application in a second. What I really want to know is what makes the open source community so special? Why do people feel like they can reach out to each other, that they can help each other? Tell me more about that. I think that people don't realize that seeing, seeing a stranger multiple times in public doing awesome things is like, oh, you're that person that did that thing. Oh, you're the person that did that thing before. Oh, I've seen you before. Like you just sometimes need a couple of sleeps between you to go and this person seems safe. I've seen them at meetups. I, I really like their projects. Like we, we saw earlier when we did the Scott and Mark learn to vibe. You know, Simon Willison, like he and I have blogged

**[3:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=197s)** and known each other digitally for 25 years, right. So you just, you send that person a message and you say, hey, I like the cut of your jib kid. You want to come and hang out. And open source people and community people are builders and they're excited to build. And they're like, yeah, that'd be cool. I called Steve and I called Cassidy and I called Swix. I was like, hey, you want to do this? And they're like, yeah, that's cool. I'm down. That vibe, that positivity is what makes the open source community approachable because it's a it's like improv. When you do improv, you always want to have a partner who goes yes. And so imagine building software. Peter says, I want to do open claw. And then he meets Vincent and he meets Dallin and he meets, you know, all these different great people in the community and they go, hey, want to do this?

**[4:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=246s)** Oh yes, and I'll add this little herbs and spices and I'll add that. And I have this open source project and they start building now. That you started talking about, you know, working with Peter and Vincent, you mentioned that they work in a different way. Can you tell me more about that and how essentially how do they work? What do people or like developers at Microsoft can learn internally, but then also what can other people learn about the way that they work with agents? So the word let's move away from agents for a second and talk about the concept of agency. One of the things that Vincent Koch said, who is the chief architect of Open Claw Foundation with Peter, he's kind of Peter's number two said is I like high agency people, meaning, you know, just fix it. Just do it like fix it.

**[4:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=294s)** You have you have agency to fix that. We have the tests. We have a quality software development life cycle. We have all the unit tests, all the integration tests, all the smoke tests. If this thing is a bad change, it won't make it all the way out the process. This is not a thing that is run on vibes. This is an AI augmented software engineering project at scale. Fastest growing open source project ever. And if something is broken, somebody should fix that. And that I think that sense of like me, I can, I can fix that. So there's been a number of times when I'll ask Vincent or Peter, they're like, yeah, this thing is broken and they're like, you going to fix it? And that is really cool. So I feel like people should be more bold and try going out there because yeah, if it breaks, then

**[5:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=344s)** you know, we'll fix it. You know, you in your keynote you mentioned the app companion folks, you mentioned that you have worked with also the Windows engineers. When you guys were working on this, was there anything in particular that you said, hey, like this is different and this is something that I'm really excited to bring to everybody, like something that is essentially like unique or we're trying to be better than we were before. Well. I think there's a couple of things. So step step zero was there was an existing companion app that helps you get open cloud running on a

**[6:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=392s)** Mac. So when we started, when I took my original version, my goal was to have parity with the Mac. I want to be able to go 1:00 to 1:00. And then the questions were what is Windows can, what can Windows do that is different? What can Windows do that is unique? How do we package our apps? How do we do permission? How can I sandbox this app differently? It's not like a competition as it is a coopetition. Like I want open cloud to be great everywhere and I would like to have a little extra judge on on Windows because I like Windows and I get to work with the Windows development team. So it's a, it is a thumb war as each thing gets better, but it raises, to mix my metaphors, it raises the water level for everybody. So like MXC, which we launched and will continue to get better.

**[7:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=439s)** Being able to have a spectrum of containment, I think you're going to see really cool features that we're still thinking up. And after the keynote, you know, Peter came out and had some crazy mad scientist idea and they're off running and trying to figure that out like those ideas. And he said, oh, you should talk to this person and then they start talking and then they go running. That's the vibe. So Microsoft, I think is learning to go fast, but we have to go fast at a, at a larger scale. You know, when you have a billion users, you want to make sure that they're all happy. So there's going to be a comfortable tension. And I think that's what's going to make us successful. Can you tell me more about containers and containment? I thought that that was very interesting how you said that on the keynote. That was a funny bit of AI like alliterations. And I said, yeah, I've got all of the things

**[8:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=487s)** available to me. I have containers and containment. I think that leadership and like people in suits think that there's a, there's basically a slider bar with three clicks and it's nothing is in a container. This is in a container. And then there's hypervisor, which is like a virtual machine, but there's there's many, many, many click stops. When we say containers, like containers in the classic sense of container, an OCI container, you usually think about Docker. Now Docker is a brand in a company just like Kleenex is a brand. But if I say hand me a Kleenex, I don't necessarily mean a Kleenex brand tissue. It could be any generic brand, right? So Docker is a company that uses containers and pod man that can do containers and there are other things

**[8:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=536s)** you can do containers. So we launched WSLC, which is a container runtime. So we can now run containers on Windows within the guise and the support of of WSL. So we have now support for containers on Windows out-of-the-box, which is awesome. Containment is a generalized kind of like I drew a dotted line around some work and I don't want it to escape. So if I was going to say, make a container for you to call Work IQ and get your details from Work IQ and your Outlook calendar, arguably it shouldn't be going to your Google Calendar. Arguably it shouldn't be writing text files and sneaking around and doing stuff. It should have access to do the thing and it should work perfectly. Whether that runs in a container, which is an implementation

**[9:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=586s)** detail, or it runs in some containment technology and some generic containment technology. Imagining it could be process containment, session containment, micro VM containment, full VM containment. That's up to some business person above us to decide. So Linux containers is a thing, containment is a concept. Was there anything working on this that made you change how develoers are going to start doing their work? Like in terms of like system needs, in terms of like their workflow. Now that you're seeing, you know, agents working and like the container and containments and you know all that thing between what developers do and use and then what IT

**[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=635s)** admins require to actually make this work in work environments. Yeah, I think that the thing that has been the most helpful thing, it's a small little thing the get work trees. I think people are used to working in branches. You check something out into a folder that's like D: back slash Monica, and then that's your folder and you're working on the Monica app and you go to main and you go to this and you go to that. But what if you had a branch in a separate folder that was its own work tree that was related? I could then run multiple agents. So instead of switching around, I get this opportunity for doing things in parallel. So I've been running three to five agents in parallel and learning from how the folks at the Open Claw community do stuff. They'll sometimes run dozens, but I stick around 3:00 to 5:00.

**[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=684s)** That I think is a real unlock. And the GitHub app, the GitHub Copilot app has that work tree support built in. So I think as people start to get that app as it comes out of preview, I think they're going to be able to see how cool the combination of a Windows machine plus a dev drive plus work trees is. It's it's pretty nice. It's pretty nice workflow. Let's talk a little bit about the future. We are now seeing this new generation generation of agents that get a lot of access that can basically like go and essentially do things proactively. I have been seeing other agents that, for example, are learning through machine learning. Are you seeing any other trends happening within agents that you, you know, foresee in the next few months or

**[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=734s)** like in the next year or so? As we get towards the end of this conversation, I think the thing we should be thinking about is how dynamic policies that allow the agent to do exactly what it needs to do, but no more. It's not one policy fits all. We're going to see policy engines and each individual tool call, each individual piece of intent won't go into a generic container that has abilities to contain things, but it'll be dynamically generated for it. So that slider bar is going to change on a tool call by tool call basis. And what we want is for it to be invisible to the user and fully in control by IT. So literally everybody wins. And if the container works, you didn't even know it was contained, it just worked. Throughout this time I have seen you be very intentional

**[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0klw6aVw04&t=784s)** with how you do and thank you so much for all the work that you have been doing. Appreciate it. I try to be intentional and thank you for noticing.
