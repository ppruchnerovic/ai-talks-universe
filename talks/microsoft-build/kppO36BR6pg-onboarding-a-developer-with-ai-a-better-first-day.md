**[0:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=5s)** Hello everyone, good to see you. Today I want to talk about the developer joins your team, not the HR onboarding, not the badge pickup. The moment your team is your team open a repo they never seen a wonder where to start. For the next 25 minutes, I'm going to show you how was that moment change when the AI agent sits next to you. I'm Michel Riber, I work for Avanade in France. As you can listen my accent, I'm sure you know I'm in French, but I assume it's difficult to change. Sorry.

**[0:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=53s)** I'm MVP for 17 years. A long time. 3 numbers to set the scene. 3 to 9 months. That's how long it takes on average for a developer to become fully productive in a new code base, not to ship their first commit to actually be autonomous. It's a long time. 40%. That's how much of week of week 1 is spent reading code, not writing it, just reading. And that's normal, except that reading time is usually solitary and dependent how good the documentation is. And as we know, the documentation is generally obsolete, not

**[1:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=108s)** up to date. That's the reality. That's the fact. One in three question. This may be my favorite because when you start on a new project, one in three questions never get asked out loud. Because the new developer is afraid of looking dumb, because the tech lead is in a meeting, because the question feels too basic to this other slack these three numbers. This is not an HR problem. This is what we call developer experience. That's exactly what we are going to attack today for facts.

**[2:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=162s)** Actor one, understand the code base, get from zero to a mental map in minutes. Actor 2 surface the hidden context, the decision that shaped the code and never made it into the docks. Actor three, identify what and who really matters, critical components and the white people to talk to. Actor 4 ship the first contribution, a real PR that follows the team's convention on day one. At the beginning I wanted to do all this demo full live, but when you use AI agents, sometimes it takes minutes rather than seconds, so I prefer to do

**[3:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=211s)** a studio life demo. To make this concrete, I present to you, I introduced to you Sara. She is a fictional developer, but the situation she's in, you've all seen it. Day one new team repo. She never opened. So with me. Last updated 14 months ago. So Alvron, it's not up to date. The tclid is meeting until 5:00 PM, so difficult to have a conversation with him, to understand the architecture, to understand the project, the code base, more than 2000 files in the code base, a real code base, more than

**[4:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=262s)** five different languages, Python, react.net, SQL and so on. And we need to tackle with legacy and actual code, recent code and the implicit deadline for the new developer. First PR at the end of the week. Nobody tells you, but everyone expected that the situation. So when Sarah opens the code base this is what she has. This code base come from open source project. Post hog I just picked that open source project by default. I have no relation with this code base. But what I wanted is a code base that has

**[5:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=312s)** a long history. The more history you have the more the better agent will be. So actor one Sara opens her agent and asks the more natural question in the world. I just joined the team. Give me a tour, give me the entry point. Explain to me the code base, not from technical part but also functional part. So this is a query I ask to my agent. Notice it's not just listing the folders at workspace gives copyloads the actual code in context, it's within import recent commits and inferring boundaries from how the code actually connects.

**[6:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=367s)** So I launched this point and then the agent will analyze all the code base, the 2000 files and it will explain to me what are the main entry points. For example, to have this kind of response, normally you should have a 2 hour whiteboard session with a tacloid. So in 2-3 minutes you've got all the information. Here I've got the description of the front end which is developed in React. So also I've got the different entry point and that's it.

**[6:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=415s)** Here I've got the explanation of the node dot JS server with a different method, the different modules, the different class and the file where I can find the class. The agent will give me the architecture and the data flow from the front to the back with a different method, a different class. It will also explain the query path from the back, the front end to the back end and the different Kafka topics. So it will really understand the code base and so Sara can understand quickly what what is the project and where, where to find the correct the correct code.

**[7:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=469s)** It will also analyse what is the active code versus the older code. So here I've got the different folder where the code is really active in the last month and here where I can find the legacy code. Sometimes it's code that is never used, but it's code that will not involve the from several months. And what is really interesting is I asked the agent give me the diagram of all the class of the project. It's not in the documentation. It's created by analyzing the code base and the relationship between the different classes, the different dependencies. If I zoom in, this is the diagram made by

**[8:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=522s)** the agent. No documentation, just the code base. And that's very impressive. In just three minutes you've got all this information. How to do this is where it gets interesting. Sarah has a map now, but a map doesn't tell you why the road were drawn that way. She needs a context the documentation doesn't contain. This is a prompt. The new prompt I sent to the agent. Now I ask to the agent, look at this file final dot PY.

**[9:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=571s)** Why does the file exist? What problem was it built to solve? As you can see now I add at GitHub, it's not just reading the code, it's pulling PR description, commit messages, issue threads to understand all the history of the module, not just the last version, but all the histories, the different steps, the different milestone for this particular module. So you will think during several seconds and at the end what I have, it will explain to me the raging, the motivation and the major re factor for this module based on the code base and all the PR,

**[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=622s)** the commits, all the documentation it can analyze, it can index. It will also explain the core algorithm for this module. And then it will explain to me the full story from PR and commits. So as you can see this project started in 2021, so a long history. So at the beginning they use Krikaus Enterprise Edition. If we go deeper Phase 2, they replace this version by the open source version. So I've got also the PR with a different refactor, so then I can analyze manually if I want 3 the next step they decide to replace Postgres by criccaos

**[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=676s)** and so on. And then I've got the timeline with a different milestone for this module. So I can really understand what are the technical decision what what is the real history of this module and just in few seconds without documentation next next question to the agent. I see that post hogs this open source project uses Krikaus for analytics queries instead of post grade. So I asked the agent find the original decision behind that choice. What why they migrate from post grade to Krikaus And

**[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=727s)** the same you will analyze all the decision about Krikaus in the repository in the PR and then they will explain me the different phases, different milestone, the preexisting POC. Before 2020 Phase 2 they had a pain point with Posegre. So I know the reason why they analyzed Posegre versus Picaus because they had a specific pain point. If you if you read it will explain the what is the pinpoint. I think it's a performance issue they have for specific queries. Phase 3 they did comparison with different solution to replace

**[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=778s)** Fosgrae. Phase four, they started the migration, so they decided to move from persuade to Kekaus. So I know I've got the milestone, I've got a different issue and the PR where they start the the migration. And then as previous I explained earlier, we've got a different timeline from the succession of to do POC. Why they choose Kekaus? Why they evaluate the different database? They evaluate the migration epic, the first implementation PR and when Cacaos was in production one again just by analyzing

**[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=830s)** the Kitab repository. Next I ask to my agent what are the unwritten conventions. So I asked the agent to explain to me what are the convention in the code base for error handling, for logging, for naming convention and so on. Not based on the documentation, but based on the real active code. So the agent will answer after a few seconds or so. The logger he will explain what I have to develop use, what the code I use, sorry what the code I have to use rather than the the second one. So I need to use import structured instead of logging

**[14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=882s)** that the convention implemented in the existing project. Same for the error handling. You will explain what I have to do based on the convention of the of the team. You will also explain how to implement the logging in my code. So act 3 Sarah now understand the code base, she has the context. Now she needs to prioritise the the work she has to do. This query I will understand. I will ask the agent what are the five files

**[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=932s)** I absolutely need to read first, what are the main parts of the code? And the agent will answer so it will give me the five important files, team routine and so. And here's the mental model after analyzing the five files, then I'm going to ask also to to the agent who are the main contributors for the core model, because I need to, if I have a question about this module, who should I contact to have a discussion, to understand, to explain a specific point. So thanks to the PR, to the committee, I can

**[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=983s)** retrieve who is the owner of the module. So then I can ask question to the to this guy. Sometimes an agent has a strange behavior. Instead of give me the name, it just gives me the command to execute. Well, it's it's an, it's not an illustration, but it's a strange behavior of the of the agent. The the main point is I've got the different query to execute if I want to know who are the best contributors. So Sarah can execute, can launch this command if she want active 4. The last one shipped the first PR.

**[17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=1034s)** So I need to read an issue, I need to plan the approach, I need to implement following the convention, run the test, debug and grab the PR description. So for that I use a real issue of this project of the post org project. So I select this one 58757 and then I will ask to the agent will the issue explain what is the issue, what are the technical change imply and which file should I update. So he will read the issue. He will explain to me what what is the issue and what are the file I should modify.

**[18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=1084s)** So he will explain the code what are the updates I need to to made to be successful. So he will explain all the in all the files what I have to to modify. Then before I can't do by myself the update, but I can ask the agent do the update. So before writing the code I just ask to the agent give me an approach find me the revamp files. So give me the the workflow, give me the strategy to apply this issue. But don't update the code for the moment. So it will analyze the root cause, it will analyze,

**[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=1136s)** it will advise to me to change the back end of the database by adding a new column. It will give me the serializer, it will give me all the code I have to implement. So now I analyze this plan. As the plan is OK. So now I ask the agent implement the fix, let's do it. And here if you see the the the red lines on the right, it's what the agent updated to fix the the issue. Now the agent applies the the update. Now I ask the agent run the test to verify

**[19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=1187s)** that I've got no regression and if you find if a test fail, debug it and fix it. After that. I wanted to we can imagine the tests are OK. I want to draft the PR description. Once again I asked the agent what is the convention in the team? What is the structure of the PR? So he will analyse the last PR out its structure and he will give me the description automatically. So he will put you will define the title, the problem, the different change made by the to fix the issue in the back end, the front end.

**[20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=1240s)** Oh sorry. And he will also. As you can see the PR was observed by an agent. So I know that to fix this issue I use copilot and cloud sonnet 4.6. That's very important to twice the the issue. If you if you have got the following position sweep and sibalt to take home AI as a context engine, not a code generator. In the onboarding process, the value is not inviting code, it's in understanding what already exists. Don't judge an agent by how well it writes judge. Judge it now how well it explained the code base is.

**[21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=1287s)** Is the documentation an agent with what actually what actually there, not what we wish was there. That changed your relationship with documentation. Fewer pages to maintain, more investment in the code base. So it's important that the code base is readable, it's important that you put some good comments on your code to to allow the agent to analyse the context globally. And the last senior time is the scariest resource. Every question asked answered by by AI is focused returned to the team. So it's not a replacement of the human, it's like an assistant or a pair programmer that will help you to understand and to resolve the different issue.

**[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=1343s)** So try it on Monday, give you the next hire an AI agent, measure time to 1st PR. That's a very important metric if you can. If you cannot improve it, you've got a problem in your in your cut days before AI, after AI, compare the time you you have from the day one to the first PR. So to conclude, onboarding used to be a test of patience. With AI, it can become a test of curiosity. That's my favorite maxim. So what I want, what I wanted to demonstrate today

**[23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppO36BR6pg&t=1392s)** is in boarding it's one prompt, one plan, 1 PR day one. So in reality is not one day but in few days rather than few months, you can on board a new developer and the developer will be more productive. If you get any question, you can contact me via Linkin if you want. We don't have time to answer question today except if you meet me during the the build. Thanks for your time. Have a good have a great build.
