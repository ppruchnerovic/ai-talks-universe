## Description

Accessibility is often viewed as a usability feature or compliance requirement, important but secondary. In AI‑driven systems, that no longer holds. LLMs interpret the content we produce, and their reliability depends on structure, semantics, and clarity. Accessible content is easier for humans and machines to understand, process, and reuse. This session reframes accessibility as a systems‑level engineering concern, showing why it outperforms OCR and leads to safer, more predictable AI outcomes.

**[0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=1s)** GUUST YSEBIE: Hello, LM. So today we're going to talk a little bit about designing systems for every user including people and LLMs. My name is Guust Ysebie and I'm currently working as a software engineer enterprise where I mostly work on our PDF as the gate. So I also work a lot on accessibility within PDFs and that's the knowledge I want to share with you today. PDF documents today are not only consumed by people. They are also being consumed by LLMs. So they should be as accessible as possible for both these consumers. Which principles are useful for everyone? The first one is perceivable. It needs to be operable.

**[0:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=48s)** It needs to be understandable. And it needs to be robust. Why am I telling you all of this? It's because it's all of those kind of issues that both humans and LLMs encounter when working with PDF documents. Let's have a quick look at the PDF. When you have physical data format it means that you can use different kinds of formats like fonts, like images, videos, put them together in to one. The most important parts you'll have to understand is the drawing language, and the drawing language is just drawing instructions which you can see displayed. What this does is when you have a canvas like a PDF page it just simply says like, "Move to this certain location and then we need to draw these characters on this exact location."

**[1:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=99s)** This ensures that when you open the PDF I created that your PDF knows exactly on which pixel to render which content. The pixels and characters are like very different from what we actually do when we look at the PDF. Those pixels we can actually design a reading order to it. We understand its semantics then and based on drawing of the (inaudible) like lines, like list symbols, we can determine what the order (inaudible) the data to be in. Of course if you're an LLM you don't have all that kind of meta information out of the box. The LLM just looks at the page and sees pixels. So it's very hard for LLMs then to extract the data from it. You would lose either a lot of tokens where you need

**[2:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=151s)** to have training or you would need those text extraction so you can actually first extract the data from it and then train your LLM on the data. So what you have to remember here is what we see is very easy for us because we are trained on it, but LLMs don't have this and so it's very hard for them to interpret the actual meaning behind those pixels. If you, for example, would have a PDF, LLMs actually are quite good in extracting this kind of data. But, as you can see on the left side, it doesn't have any structure. It doesn't really know what means what. Yeah. We can make a guess and you will input probably as a title. But it's very hard and very inefficient to train your LLMs

**[3:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=204s)** on because it can't apply semantic reasoning on to the context. On the right side, on the other hand, exactly the same context, but now we added semantic meaning. We added which part of the document is actually a header, which one is a table, and as you can see it will be far more easier for the LLM and for your normal users to actually extract the semantic meaning. So in PDFs, normal PDFs, didn't really have like this kind of system where you can take contents with semantic meaning. But of course PDF evolved and now it includes a mechanism for this. This mechanism is text PDFs. You as a developer have the advantages because low level tools do it for you

**[4:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=255s)** because if we open the PDF now, for example here, we can quickly see that now on the right we have our text structure. So it means we actually have kind of the same structure you would know from HTML while still having pixel perfect rendering on the left. So now we for sure know that for example the text in blue is in H1. Below it is a paragraph. And then we have a table. So now we have pixel perfect rendering and we have complete semantic information and meta data about our document. So because we now have like this bunch of semantic information, bunch of meta data, and creating tools on top of PDFs are far more easy. Now we can just look in to our text structure

**[5:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=304s)** and see which text is there. This means assistive technology, search, extraction, and all the other things are far more easier to implement because now we have a structured model of the data that we display within our PDF document. Text extraction is probably one of the most interesting things because lots of developers need to process a bunch of PDF documents. So for our table today I did a quick demo where I built an LLM data pipeline and on the first (inaudible) we're going to use OCR based solution. We are going to use Docling in our circumstance. Why? Because it's the most well used and one of the best tools out there.

**[5:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=352s)** It's open source as well. And on the other hand we are going to use iText as the gate to leverage the embedded text system within the PDF which contains all the meta data. Instead of trying to analyze pictures, to actually extract the content we really want to. So let's get started. So we have this PDF document. This is just a normal summary with some tables, some lists, and some stress tests where we have, for example, a water mark in to it and some very tiny little text. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to run Docling on it. And we're going to convert it to a mark down file. Why mark down file? Mark down files are very information dense

**[6:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=401s)** so it means you have semantic information. So let's run Docling first. This script is quite easy and can just be executed with item. This just reads the PDF document and calls the correct library functions to convert it to a mark down. While this is running and trying to extract the data if we have a look at this this is still warming up. It's loading a bunch of its models. This only has to be done once, of course, for Docling. And so now it will start doing the actual conversion. As you see, it takes a bit of time. So now you can see it's finally done.

**[7:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=453s)** So to convert those four pages of information based on processing the OCR so processing the pixels it takes about 18 seconds. So if we look at the output we generated from this we see it's actually quite good. We have all the tables. We have the lists. We have even the difficult languages. But we also have the water mark, for example, which is not something we really want. So it's not the author intent to be actually extracted. And this might be used if you're using OCR tools to (inaudible) training data because then the data will also be in to your mark down file and it might be used or abused to jailbreak your LLM.

**[8:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=505s)** So how does it compare to the basic Java implementation where we use iText to actually extract the data and the meta information from it? Now it's a far different story. So now you see it's only 0.75 seconds. Excuse me. 0.075 seconds. So it's 200 times faster than the OCR implementation. And not only that. If we look at the output you see the tables look exactly the same. The content looks exactly the same. But, for example, the water mark which the author didn't intend to be actually displayed or to be used or to be actual important data is not there as we expected, and it's of course a lot better for security reasons and all

**[9:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=559s)** of that, all those things. But what you also have to take in to account, if we compare the list of which it notes we see here PDF OCR didn't manage to actually extract that those were sublists. Why? Again because the semantic meaning was lost from the document while if you are using the meta data which was embedded in to the document you see the sublist is correctly constructed. This means that the Docling OCR actually generates like some kind of mistakes which are very hard to trace and those mistakes can compound over time which in the end produces very wrong output formats. So that was the table. As you can see, we generate the same mark down documents

**[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=608s)** to then train our LLMs models to extract the business data that we require. So what do we have to remember here? We need to design for understanding not just rendering, and that's especially the case in PDF documents. So when you are producing a PDF you should enable that, the meta data, as being embedded. This can be done in most PDF libraries by enabling a flag. Then you have to make sure that those tags are correct and convey the author's intent of the PDF document. And if you do those two steps you'll have a bunch of advantages you get for free. You get smart data extraction. You get easy search. And your PDF documents are accessible.

**[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI81nVWmWU&t=658s)** So you have to remember accessibility isn't extra work. What you do now is only a few more minutes of work and that means that your AI infrastructure which you will build in the next following years will be so much better at processing all your documents which means you will have gained a competitive edge just because you make your data accessible to both users and LLMs. All right. Thank you very much. If there are any questions please don't hesitate to contact me or enterprise and we will gladly help you out.
