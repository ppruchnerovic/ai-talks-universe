## Description

PwC research found the top barrier to AI agent impact isn't the technology; it's connecting agents across applications and workflows to truly operate like coworkers. Most organizations deploy agents in isolation, then wonder why value stalls. This session explores how APIs serve as the relationship layer between AI models and encourage meaningful adoption, using Napster's Omniagent API as a working example of how to move agents from standalone tools to embedded, cross-functional collaborators.

**[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=0s)** EDO SEGAL: Welcome to the Napster Companion API session. If you're here, you're probably curious about video multimodal agents that you can deploy in your application. One of the core areas of friction for doing this has been the cost. We've been working for the last three years on reducing the cost and engineering the heck out of it, so we can deliver it to you at a cost-effective way, so you can actually scale it to millions of users. And we've also made it incredibly easy for you to deploy them. So literally within one day, you can add a video multimodal agent to your agentic application. This adds another layer of human connection to everything you're building, as we're already seeing in the wild with some of the world's biggest companies. We'll share some examples, as well as walk you through how to actually build it yourself in a matter of hours. Over to Ziv Navoth, our Chief Product Officer.

**[0:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=51s)** ZIV NAVOTH: Thanks, Edo. Let's start with cost because for many developers, that's been the gating factor. Real-time multimodal video agents have been technically possible for a while. What hasn't been possible is shipping them at scale. The Omniagent API runs at only one cent per render minute when you bring your own LLM. That's roughly 20 times cheaper than the alternatives. Enough that a five-minute customer call costs five cents, and a full-time agent running eight hours a day costs less than $5. So that's a shift that makes this a production tool instead of a proof of concept. Now, let's talk about how this fits in your stack. The Omniagent API is Azure Native. The browser-side SDK opens an HTTPS and WebRTC connection through Azure's Front Door and load balancing solutions.

**[1:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=103s)** Our network stack also has private endpoint support. Omniagent core pods run in Azure Kubernetes Service, auto-scaled. The orchestration layer can talk to your own Azure OpenAI deployment, or it can talk to ours. The real-time multimodal rendering pipeline runs on dedicated Azure VM clusters and streams synchronized video back over WebRTC with low round-trip latency. Every component you see in this stack is running on an Azure managed service. Omniagent delivers three additional benefits. First, single cloud billing. The line item shows up on your existing Azure invoice. Second, your existing governance policies just keep working. The same Azure Policy, Defender, and DDoS protection you already have applies to this. Third, multi-provider support.

**[2:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=154s)** Bring whichever LLM you've already deployed. Swapping providers is a key change, not a rewrite. It's the same agent configuration either way. Siemens is one of our key deployments. Their field service technicians interact with manufacturing systems through voice and video instead of dashboards and manual commands. The same architecture is running customer service, sales onboarding, and corporate training. Identical runtime, but a different agent. Let me show you how this comes together, from provisioning the resource to the live agent in your application in three steps: create, deploy, monitor. Let's build one. Step one, create your agent. The Omniagent API is part of your Azure account. You spin it up directly from the Azure portal,

**[3:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=204s)** the same way you'd create a Cosmos DB or any other Azure resource. No separate purchase, no separate vendor, no separate bill. It lives alongside the rest of your Azure stack. Once it's running, open the Omniagent API dashboard. We'll walk through it click by click. Everything you see here is also available through the REST API itself, so you can build it click by click or call it from your code. A quick word on the anatomy of an agent before we build one. There are four parts. The Omniagent is the face, the voice, and the personality. The knowledge is the documents and data that the agent grounds its answers in. FAQs are the curated questions and answers for things you want handled the same way every time. And tools are what the agent calls out to when it needs to take action on the user's behalf.

**[4:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=254s)** Omniagent plus knowledge plus FAQs plus tools. That's your agent. Now, let's go and build one. On the dashboard, you'll see two buttons: New Omniagent and New Digital Twin. An Omniagent is a fictional agent for support, sales, onboarding, or any role inside your application. A digital twin is an agent configured to represent a specific person: their likeness, their voice, their style, their personal knowledge. You don't even have to start from scratch. Napster ships a library of stock agents, pre-built personas across common roles. Pick one, customize it, and you're off. Or, build your own from scratch. Today, we're building Vera, a field service specialist. We give her a name, upload a photo, and the system spins

**[5:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=303s)** up a lifelike video avatar. Then, we wire up the rest. We attach knowledge. Vera already has the equipment service manuals, the parts catalog, and the diagnostic procedures. Today, we're adding the Atlas service knowledge. We add FAQs. She already has the equipment safety protocols and the parts and warranty FAQ. Today, we're adding the field service FAQ. And we attach tools. This is what Vera uses to take action on the user's behalf.

**[5:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=353s)** She already has get service history, look up part, order part, schedule inspection, and escalate to engineering. A pretty comprehensive toolbox. But today, we're going to add get customer lookup, so she can resolve a customer ID into a name. Omniagent knowledge, FAQs tools. That's Vera, defined once. But before we ship her, we test her in the playground. VERA: Hi, how can I help you? Marcus: Hey, Vera. I'm on site at customer 4421. The compressor is short-cycling. What should I check? VERA: Hey, Marcus. That's Northgate Industrial, same compressor we worked on last month. Their model has a known high-pressure switch issue.

**[6:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=402s)** Let me pull their service history. Three pressure-related work orders in six months. Want me to open a parts request? Marcus: Yeah, go ahead. VERA: Done. The switch will be at your local depot by tomorrow morning. I've also scheduled a follow-up inspection for 30 days out. This unit needs closer monitoring. Marcus: Thanks, Vera. VERA: Good luck with the install. Call back if anything comes up. ZIV NAVOTH: That's the same Vera we just built. When she behaves the way we want, we can move on to deploy. The agent is multimodal by design, so it ships across the channels your users actually use. We also refer to this as an Omniagent. On the web, the web SDK opens a WebRTC connection and renders the video agent inside your application

**[7:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=451s)** as a sales agent on your pricing page, a support concierge in your help center, an onboarding guide on your homepage. Lifelike presence, real-time voice, mounted to any element on your page. In your native mobile or desktop app, the WebSocket handler streams real-time voice between the app and the agent. Voice first, no browser required. On the phone, the agent answers inbound SIP and VoIP calls. An after-hours support line, an intake agent on your main number, a callback for high-priority customers. Your customers dial a regular phone number. The agent picks up. On text, the agent routes through your messaging channel of your choice. Same agent, same memory, same tools. You can also turn on memory at this layer.

**[8:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=502s)** When you start a session for a user, you tell the Omniagent API to remember. From that point on, the agent extracts facts, summarizes conversations, and carries that context forward automatically. Memory follows the user across every channel. Start the conversation in your web app, continue it on the phone, pick it up over text the next morning. Same agent, with the same context, and no re-explaining. Step three: Monitor. Every conversation the agent has on every channel is captured and inspectable. Open any session, and you see the full transcript, every tool the agent called, every memory read and write, and the identity of the user. End-to-end audit, native to the platform. Track the outcomes that matter.

**[9:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyhNmi3TWc&t=551s)** How many issues did the agent resolve? How many actions did it take? Iterate the prompt, redeploy, and watch the numbers move. That's the platform. A multimodal AI co-worker, you can spin up in your Azure tenant in minutes, running on your own LLM, deployed across every channel your customers use, and inspectable end-to-end. Three things for you to take away. First, it's available today on Azure. Provision it from the portal the same way you'd provision any other Azure resource. Second, once you're signed up, the quickstart will get you to a running agent in under 15 minutes. Bring your existing Azure OpenAI deployment, and you're off. And third, if you're here at Build, come find us at our booth. We'll build a co-worker with you live. Thanks for your time.
