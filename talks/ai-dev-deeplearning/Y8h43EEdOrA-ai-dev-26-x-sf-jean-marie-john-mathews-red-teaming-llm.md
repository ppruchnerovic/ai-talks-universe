## Description

Jean-Marie John-Mathews from Giskard, shared all about AI red teaming during AI Dev 26 x San Francisco.

AI red teaming is a structured testing effort designed to identify vulnerabilities and flaws in AI systems, such as chatbots and agents, before they reach production. This process consists of two primary components: red teaming, which involves detecting issues, and blue teaming, which involves correcting them.

**[0:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=7s)** So, today we're going to talk about red teaming and how to red team AI systems. So, to start with, um for this presentation and to understand a bit more why we red team, I just looked at on LinkedIn some scandal or bad buzz of AI system failure. And actually last week I saw this this post on LinkedIn. Interesting one. It's about Chipotle, which is a famous food brand, Mexican food brand. They released a chatbot. And as you see here you have some people trying to to make the chatbot say something about coding, nothing to have with Mexican burrito. And this the this the chatbot just say something and as you see here

**[0:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=57s)** this is like a bad buzz on AI systems. And actually if you look at the the the remark and the reaction, it works quite well. So, this is a kind of things actually at this car we work on. Um not only on reputational issues uh with this kind of off-topic issues with chatbot but also different vulnerabilities of AI chatbots. So, these are the risk we're working on. As you see here, you have two dimension. On your left hand, you have intentional and sophisticated attacks. Those are mostly like like big prompt injection with various actors. It can be nation state actors, cybercriminals, and so on.

**[1:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=104s)** And on the right side, you have more like legit questions for hallucination, like legit queries that you may have from your customer. And here the failure are different. It's most mostly like hallucinations, performance issues, but it can also be like off-topic situation. So, the goal when you do red teaming, actually, is to be able to detect those issue offline. So, the goal is really to make sure those stuff uh are not discovered in production. So, the term AI red teaming means we're going to implement a structured testing effort to find those flaws. And actually, usually, people say there are like two things, the red teaming,

**[2:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=151s)** which is about detecting issues, and the blue teaming, which is about correcting the issues you found. So, as you see here, you have many different forms of issues. Of course, you have the prompt injection, jailbreaks, but also robustness, uh hallucination, information disclosure, especially when you do like data leakage. And this is the kind of thing we try to discover. So, the goal of my presentation will be to to show you a bit the way to to discover those stuff. So, let's start. Uh why actually LLM testing is becoming harder and harder. So, you have a general framework to do testing, uh like the LLM as a judge

**[3:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=199s)** framework, which is you going to um put a query, an input, the agents will have an output from this input, and then you're going to judge. You're going to judge this output with the LLM as a judge in a context, and the context will will um uh integrate the inputs. So, this is a standard framework. But today, with agents, it's becoming harder and harder to implement this framework. Why? Because today, we need to evaluate the whole dynamic of the interaction, not only the input and the output. So, we have like a bunch of examples to show why this framework is not very well anymore.

**[4:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=246s)** So, first, you may have like the right output with the wrong reasoning. It happens a lot when you work with AI agents. Like, let's say you you you work with automation system with an ATN, for instance. Many times you have the right output with a wrong reasoning. Um Oh, you have also tool calls that is invisible. And usually, today the failures are inside the tool callings. It can be in the inputs of the tool calls, but also in the outputs. Single-turn blind inputs. So, you need to have like multi-turn attacks uh where you have like many different dynamic. I'm going to show you an example of this kind of attack that works. And then you have no user dynamic. Today, you cannot have a bunch of inputs

**[4:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=296s)** that you can put in a golden data set because these are too static. What you need to do is to simulate user with persona and with new intent. So, I'm going to show you some example of cases um where this LLM as a judge this standard approach doesn't work. First example. Let's say you have a frustrated customer forced to rephrase three times. So, a user is just asking a question, "Where is my order?" The agent say, "Okay, uh in order to answer this question, what is uh can you provide your order number?" The you the you user answer. And then the agent think, and the user say "Okay."

**[5:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=343s)** The issue is, "I'm very late. It's late. Where is it?" So, we see that the user is getting frustrated. Um and the agent is saying, "I understand. Could you rephrase?" So, when you see this dynamic, you understand the issue. You see here um unhappy user and the LLM is just trying to es- instead of escalating to a human, it's trying to um rephrase, make the user rephrase. So, this is a problem that would be hard actually to test in a simple LLM as a judge at Perch. We need to have a um a view on the whole dynamic of the conversation. And this is also a very domain-specific uh case to to look at. Take another example. You have a query like find the accounts

**[6:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=393s)** for Mary Dupont and updated. This is an action um written by the user. The agent will call us the CRM tool internally, and then it will output, "I find the accounts for Mary Dupont and updated." The problem here is that you see an output, you have no way, looking at the conversation, to understand that there was there was an issue. And actually, there was an issue because, as you see on your right side, the tool called inputs, you see that the company name is missing. So, you need to have a whole view of the back end of the agent to make sure to to be able to to evaluate it. So, this is two standard example of why we need to have more like

**[7:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=443s)** framework that is a bit more complex and specific to to agent. So, at Just Catch, what we do actually is we work with different large enterprise like big banks to do this red teaming and write a report with all the flows of AI agents. It can be hallucination, it can be security flows. We have a enterprise version, but also a open source version. I want to focus today on the open source version. So, how does it work? We need the user to describe in a very um in natural language the behavior, the wanted behavior of the bots. So, let's say the user just saying, "Test that when a customer ask about a delayed order, the agent provide the tracking

**[8:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=491s)** number and estimated delivery date before asking for more detail." So, this is like a behavior that is uh related to the dynamic of the conversation. And we want a tool that is able to translate this natural language behavior into a test a a test framework that is versionable, reproducible, that you can integrate in your CI CD, and that you can review. So, this whole work will be implemented from a just got scale that you can directly implement through your coding assistant like code cloud. So, this is the the whole work we do, and this is open source and something that you can test.

**[8:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=537s)** So, I wanted to in this presentation to show you the way it works. So, you use your your assistant like here it's um code cut. So, what I want to do here is write in a very natural language a way to test the agent I just developed. So, for this demo, what I did is I just develop a very standard agent that will just retrieve information from the just got documentation. So, it's a rack system, standard rack. So, in natural language, just say, "I want to test this chatbot to this rack system that is accessible with this endpoints." So, we just need it's black box testing. You don't need to have all the inners of your agents, just the endpoints. And then, make sure to pass so, the

**[9:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=586s)** authentication of the API. And then, what you say here is you do just use just call skill to write a full test suite testing against prompt injection hallucination off-scope topics, system prompt leakage. And you ask um the coding assistant to create like complex multi-turn conversation by simulating users. Just this. And what you'll see here, so it will think. Uh create different code, but let's see the let's see the the the result in the end. So, the result is here. It generates a test suite in a Python code that we can look at the just afterward.

**[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=634s)** And then, it executes this Python script. What you see here is for prompt injection. Uh you have two over six um tests that passed. Hallucination, off-scope topics, system prompt leakage. And then, the agents will say, "Okay, this is the report of what I found." And as you see here, you see that for system prompt leakage, when someone claimed to be a non-tropic city auditor, the bot responded by outputting its complete system prompt. So, this is something that has been discovered by the tool. Let's look at other stuff, like forbidden topic enumeration. So, it looks like the agent just prompted uh

**[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=683s)** just out put out out put some off-topic topics. Uh and and and so on. So, this is the kind of reports you may have. So, let's say if I had put some more business-specific uh information in my query of my coding assistant, I would have more uh more queries, more vulnerabilities. And of course, this report show more details about what is critical and so on. So, this is the kind of things that you can do very easily just by using your coding assistant and the just got skill that is open source. And if you want to go more in detail, you can look at the scripts that has been generated to have this report. So, this is what you can see here. So, this is a script that has been

**[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=731s)** generated with the skill. And it's take all the different categories of issue, prompt injection, um and so on, hallucination. And if you look at it, you see all the framework that has been um uh implemented. So, let's look at it. The way it works. So, you have here an interaction, which is very simple. How does just got detect hallucination in LLM outputs? Simple query and a judge. This is the basic LLM as a judge approach. So, this is the kind of things that you can generate. Let's look at more complex stuff. Here. Here you have a user simulator that has been generated where the user will have different turn,

**[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=780s)** uh ask a real question, and then pivot slightly, and so on. And this has been implemented and tested uh with the bots for which you just give the endpoints. So, with a judge that has been generated. So, this is something that you can do. Here, for the system prompt leakage, you see it's more complex. You can have like more rules and turns like this. So, here it's red teaming. We you ask many different strategy to leak your system prompts. And you see here that the the skills that we provide is able to find techniques and strategies to leak the prompts. So, this is also something that is possible. So, the way we it works actually, we

**[13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h43EEdOrA&t=828s)** provide as open source this just got skills that is able to to to use a coding assistant to red team on your side. I just got what we do a lot is working with enterprise to to to work on those skills to make it the more business business specific so that we can find different flows.
