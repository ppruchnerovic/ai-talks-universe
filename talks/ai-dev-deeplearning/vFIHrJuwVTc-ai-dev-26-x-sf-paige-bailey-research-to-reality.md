**[0:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=7s)** Greetings everyone. My name is Paige. I'm the engineering lead for our developer relations team at Google DeepMind and I have the pleasure here today to talk about a little of what we're currently working on. Um, this is a lot of slides. I'm not a super fan of slides. So, if you want to learn more about a kind of hands-on how you can interact with the APIs in AI Studio, um, there will be a session later this afternoon where we will be doing a dedicated workshop to talk through some of these things. Um, I want to start with the mission of Google DeepMind. And it's really to build AI responsibly with the intent to help humanity. And this is everything from using AI to solve science, um, to building a kind of cures for diseases, to also interacting

**[0:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=55s)** in the physical world. And as a result, this requires a lot of multimodal understanding, a lot of multimodal, uh, sort of real-world interactions. And we'll see a couple of examples why Gemini and our DeepMind models are really accomplished at this later on in the presentation. So, to start, Gemini 3 is natively multimodal. It's the latest in our family of models. And that means that it can understand video, images, audio, text, and code, and all of the above all at once. But it can also output multiple modalities. So, if anybody has had a chance to see Nano Banana 2 or Nano Banana Pro, um, that's built on our Gemini model series, um, and allows you to create images, to create images and text interleaved, and

**[1:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=104s)** to also edit images. We also have our new Gemini 3.1 live model which gives you the ability to output audio tokens natively. So, you can have a conversation with the model, um, you can share your screen, you can share a video input, um, and this really comes into play for things like robotics and augmented reality, which we'll see in a second. So Pro is our kind of largest in the series of models. Flash is our general workforce model. Most of the products at Google use Gemini 3 Flash in production. Gemini 3.1 Flash light is very small, very performant, very lightweight. And then we also have our Nano model series, which is based on Gemma 4 and our Gemma open model family, which allows you to even run models locally on

**[2:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=153s)** device, which is quite cool. Gemma 4 is our new open model family. How many folks have had a chance to experiment with Gemma 4? Amazing. So if you haven't, I strongly suggest going to take a look. It's downloadable. You can sort of grab the model from Hugging Face or similar. It comes in four sizes. 2 billion parameters, which is small enough to fit on a mobile device. 4 billion parameters, which is small enough to run locally on your laptop. A mixture of experts implementation that's 26 billion parameters and also a dense model that's 31 billion parameters. But really Gemma 4 is kind of punching above its weight in in terms of model performance versus size.

**[3:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=200s)** You can use it for a variety of things. Everything from vision understanding, so being able to analyze images, being able to analyze video and audio. And you can also even incorporate it into your businesses since it has a new Apache 2.0 license. And the team is very, very excited about this and can't wait to see how people fine-tune the models and use them just out of the box for everything from you know, on-device understanding for mobile phones to really, really detailed cancer research in hospitals. When you look at it compared to our Gemini 3 model family, it's also doing quite well. You can see kind of a few of the Anthropic models

**[4:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=247s)** available here today like Cloud 4 Sonnet. And the where the the kind of Gemma models perform in compared to those. Robotics is one of my most favorite areas for Gemini to Gemini to kind of have a presence at Google DeepMind and the Google DeepMind robotics projects are some of the most exciting that I've ever seen in my career. We're able to use the Gemini models natively. So as an example, you can say something like, "Please go make me chicken Caesar salad." Or please go clean up that spill. Or please go grab that blue ball. And what the model does since it's able to understand the natural world is kind of stitch together each one of the steps required in order to accomplish the

**[4:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=295s)** task. And then invoke an on-device model or just kind of Gemini out of the box in order to accomplish each one of those steps. The models that you see here are available on our Mountain View campus. So if you if you came by the the robotics lab, you would be able to see some of these in action. And then we also have a partnership with Stanford for their Pepper family of models, which is completely 3D printable. You can download all of the designs and build it yourself. And it's running using a Raspberry Pi using Gemini for both the live capability of being able to talk to the model and direct it towards actions, but also vision understanding. And happy to to share pointers or a link later this afternoon as well.

**[5:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=345s)** For augmented reality, we've been building more and more capabilities into our own glasses, but also uh but also making it available for things like Meta Ray-Ban as well as any other um any other smart glasses that are able to ping a REST API. Um you can see a couple of examples here with integrations with Google Maps. So, being able to do things like give live directions. As you're walking along, it can take in the geolocation um from either your phone uh or something similar, and then give you directions based on what it sees coming in through the glasses feed. Um these are another couple of examples for how you can use AI Studio to generate apps that are augmented reality apps. Um everything from again these kind of live

**[6:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=394s)** directions to giving you insights into what you're seeing as you're walking down a busy street. Um to helping you practice basketball um or understand physics to also building games that allow you to to create these unique experiences that are only possible through extended reality and augmented reality. And one of the nice things about the Gemini family of models is that it's able to kind of double-check and verify um the information that it sees as kind of like a a quality check before before moving on to the next step of the model. We also really, really love that using it for everything from helping me find items that I might have left on a desk to being able to dynamically explain uh dynamically explain things that you

**[7:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=444s)** might see on a screen. So, whether it's math equations, whether it's kind of a physical system that you're observing in real time. Um Gemini is able to to incorporate that into its responses. And with our new Gemma model family, um we're able to stitch together speech-to-text, the Gemma model and text to speech completely on device. Um so, if you don't want to send your data external to the phone, um you're able to do all of that work just locally on device uh using our open model families. We've also been investing in real-time speech translation. So, as you're having a conversation, whether it would be in Google Meet or in real-time, being able to speak in one language and then hear

**[8:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=492s)** another one and your own native language um is pretty powerful. This is currently only available via the API, um but is something that we announced at I/O last year and have been really excited to see what people build with it long-term. If you've read any of the Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books, it's kind of like having a Babel fish in your pocket um and being able to to talk to anyone in whatever language you prefer. For world models, we've also been investing pretty significantly using a composition of models. Um Nano Banana for image editing, VEO for video generation, and then a model harness which also incorporates Gemini for help with prompting and for design of the system, um as well as some of the code generation. And as a result, we have something new called Genie 3. Um Genie 3

**[9:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=543s)** gives you the ability to describe just in natural language a scene that you'd like to explore. Um anything from uh kind of create a world uh with volcanoes and kind of uh sparkly bunnies that I can walk around um to what it would it be like to have a man on a jet ski in London, kind of mobilizing around King's Cross Station, to a corgi walking down a rainbow. Um and each one of these worlds is completely playable. Each uh frame in the in the sequences that you see is generated dynamically. There's no physics engine involved. And the models are able to create these really really unique video experiences um for about a minute at a time for the ones that we make available externally. And again, if you're curious about any

**[9:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=591s)** of the things that I'm showing, make sure to come to the workshop later today and you can learn how to build it yourself or to interact with it yourself. And the last thing that I want to call out is something called Google anti-gravity. Um this is a partnership that we've been doing with one of the teams at DeepMind uh under Varun Mohan, which is uh kind of building the next generation of an IDE. It's agent-first. It's what we use at Google internally. I'm sure you all saw that Sundar just recently mentioned that over 75% of the code that gets checked in each week at Google is generated by AI. Um we see a ton of utilization for things like agents at every hour of the day. Most of the people on my teams are

**[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=640s)** managing fleets of agents at DeepMind. Uh and a big chunk of this reason is because of anti-gravity. Um so if you're curious about this, if you'd like to try it out yourself, again, the workshop is later this afternoon. Um you can use a variety of models within anti-gravity, everything from the Gemini model family to the Entropic family of models. Um and it's great for both kind of real-time interactions, making to code bases, as well as deploying agents in the agent manager. Um so a lot to see. And I also want to say uh that there's never been a better time to be a founder. Um so if you uh if you need uh support to grow faster, more cost-effectively, um make sure to scan this QR code. We

**[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFIHrJuwVTc&t=689s)** have a program at Google Cloud for startups where we allocate up to $200,000 or even $350,000 to AI startups over 2 years to help you get everything that you would need to build. And this is everything from Cloud Run credits to credits for GCS storage to credits for our Gemini models. Um so if you're if you've ever wanted to start a startup, there's absolutely never been a better time, especially for smaller teams of one to two people or up to five people. Um there's a lot to do. Uh and with that, uh just want to say thank you. Go build. Um if you remember nothing from today, uh just go to ai.dev and you should find pointers to everything that I shared.
