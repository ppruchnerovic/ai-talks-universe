## Description

At AI Dev 26 x San Francisco, Marc Brooker from AWS argued that the future growth of Agentic AI depends more on reducing defect rates than on advancing model capabilities. He outlined a vision for the industry:

Reliability Over Hype: He proposed moving from high-consequence errors toward a "low rate of low consequence defects" to make AI dependable for everyone.

Correctness Tools: He highlighted AWS investments in "correct by construction" frameworks like Hydro and Cedar, alongside automated reasoning tools like Lean and Strata, to ensure code and policy accuracy.

Auto-Formalization: He described using AI to turn natural language into mathematically precise specifications to prevent internal inconsistencies.

Higher Standards: He called for a shift in industry culture to prioritize reliability, suggesting new benchmarks that measure the severity of failures rather than just their density.

**[0:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=7s)** Hey, good morning. Super excited to be talking to all of you. Uh, my name is Mark Brooker. I'm a VP and distinguished engineer at AWS, and I spend my days working on Agentic AI across developer tools, tools for enterprise users, uh, the agent core runtime for, uh, for running agents, and many more products, uh, things that we're doing in the Agentic AI space. I'm a software developer. I write software for a living. I write software every day, uh, production software often. And I will say that this is the most exciting time in my career. I've been making money writing software for about 30 years, and I've never seen the pace of change like it is today, and I've never had the kind of length of lever and leverage over problems that I

**[0:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=55s)** have today. It's an incredibly exciting time to be in the software industry, and an incredibly exciting time to have the opportunity to be shaping part of that industry. But, it's not perfect yet. We've got some work to do. So, I have a hypothesis about the future. And my hypothesis is the the opportunity for agents, the opportunity size for knowledge work agents specifically, is limited by the defect rate. And so, we have seen an incredible explosion over the last 18 months or so in the kinds of work that agents can do on a good day, the kinds of things they can help us with when they are working. And we have seen a lot of improvement in the

**[1:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=104s)** defect rate, in the things that they get wrong. But, I believe that improvements in that defect rate are going to contribute more to the overall opportunity behind agents than necessarily moving the frontier forward. Let me talk a little bit about the shape of that. So here I'm going to lay out classic kind of four blocker. And we're going to look at how frequent defects are in agentic outcomes and how bad they are. And here I'm talking about outcomes from an agent loop, not outcomes from the raw model. And as you know, what makes agents interesting is they are a feedback loop. And feedback loops are one of the most powerful patterns in science and technology. You can take very faulty things and

**[2:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=153s)** build great things on top of them with the right kind of feedback. So here I'm talking about the outcome of that loop, the outcome once we have applied feedback. And how we apply that feedback. I'll also say that there's a bit of a conflation here as I talk about problems between the task to be done. Some are easier, some are harder. Some are more important, some are less important. And the capabilities of agents. And so I'm intentionally conflating these two things. So let's start by looking at the bad bad corner. High frequency of problems. High importance of problems. It's getting important things wrong often. Nobody wants to buy this product. Approximately nobody wants to buy this

**[3:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=200s)** product. There might be a short amount window where there is some hype. And people are like, "Oh, I've got to buy that product because my board is telling me to or my CEO is telling me to." But it's not going to stick. Nobody wants to be there. Then we can go up to the kinds of problems where we are seeing lots of small errors. And this is where we find slop. And slop isn't necessarily a bad thing. In our lives we have lots of the kinds of problems where we are okay with a high rate of low consequence defects. You know, summarize this short document for me. Tell me if there's anything interesting in the school newsletter. I don't really care about the defects that much, and I'm okay with the odd m dash

**[4:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=249s)** or weird sentence construction or whatever the case may be. But, the again, the opportunity here is limited. There are only so many of those kinds of problems in the world, and they tend to be the least important shape of problems. Then we get to the next corner, which is a low probability of high consequence defects in agent output. And we especially see this in places like software and systems development, where agents are building complex systems that seem correct on the surface. They're passing all the tests. They look like they're doing the right thing. You get them into production, and weird and unexpected things happen. And then who fixes those weird and unexpected things? Sets of human experts. Now, this is still great,

**[4:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=298s)** right? We still had a big acceleration in time to market. We built a cool thing. We shipped a cool thing. This isn't a bad place, but again, it is a very limiting place because we have created a dangerous and sharp tool that can only be wielded by a small number of people, and the opportunity size for that is once again limited. So, where we really want to end up is with a low rate of low consequence defects. That is where everybody can play. Everybody can come in because you don't have to be the deep expert to find and fix things. You don't have to be willing to put up with slop, and you don't have to be willing to put up with high consequence defects. This is really where the really interesting opportunity for agentic AI lives.

**[5:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=347s)** And we have to push ourselves to get there. Qualitatively, roughly hand-wavingly, over the last 18 months or so, I think we've seen a ton of progress in driving down frequency of defects, but significantly less progress, still good progress, but significantly less in driving down the or driving up agents' ability to do complex tasks in a low defect rate way. And so, another way to think about this or another way to look at this is if you have a distribution of AI outcomes, on the left tail, we have the good outcomes. Sorry, my left, your right. We have the good outcomes.

**[6:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=395s)** These are the ones that make headlines. These are the ones that get VCs excited. These are the ones that make flashy demos. They're awesome. We should keep investing in them. Let's go. On the other tail, we have the bad outcomes. These are the ones that are going to chase people away, are going to make people and organizations turn these things off. And we need to be investing there just as deeply as we're investing in the flashy stuff. Interestingly, I asked uh uh a a a frontier model to draw me this graph the other day. The first version it drew, I asked for a Cauchy distribution. The first version it drew was normal. It told me it was Cauchy. I said, "No, I don't believe you." I sent it around again. It sent me some pointy crap with a discontinuity at zero. And

**[7:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=445s)** we had to go around and around for about 15 minutes before it would stop lying to me about the shape of this distribution. I thought that was a kind of fitting example of my point. So, what are we doing about this at AWS? What are my teams and organizations doing about this? And this is going to be a small sample of a large body of work. And here I'm going to focus on the, let's say, less neural things. We're investing in a largely across a wide variety of technologies. But I want you to highlight some of our work that was, let's say, a little bit more symbolic. So, the first big investment is in correct by construction frameworks for building software and building critical pieces of software. And here I want to highlight two particular efforts. One of

**[8:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=495s)** them is Hydro. Hydro is a framework built in Rust that makes it easy for agents and humans to write correct distributed systems and protocols. This is super powerful because we know that building distributed protocols is a tremendously hard problem. And we also know that at least the current generation of models, and we're seeing indications that the next generation of models, are still not good at this problem. They are not good at reasoning through concurrency specifically and not particularly good at reasoning through failures. What Hydro does is it builds a framework that the models can use, that agents can use, that coding agents can use to build correct by construction distributed systems. And then there's Cedar. Cedar is a language designed for writing authorizers.

**[9:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=542s)** Uh it is a policy language. And it's a policy language with deep roots in reasoning and automated reasoning that again makes it much easier to be correct. We're investing deeply in places like Kira, our coding agent in spec driven development and testing, because we have found that giving a coding agent a specification as its context allows it to get much closer to correctness in the initial development, and allows it not to drift away from correctness quite as quickly as you iterate on and improve a piece of software. We're investing deeply in automated reasoning and tools to allow agents to reason about code in an automated way and a mathematically precise way.

**[9:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=591s)** One of my favorite projects here that we're investing in is an intermediate representation called Strata, which is a language that we can compile languages to and then reason over using multiple backends for automated reasoning. This is an investment [clears throat] in It's a the old school of AI powered by the new school of AI. I think it's very exciting. And all of this is powered by Lean, this incredible new proof assistant and language that is just being applied everywhere across the industry, and we are investing heavily in that at AWS. Another large area of investment is auto formalization. This is a big word. It means to take a natural language or or statement,

**[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=640s)** just a kind of common-sense SOP or statement about access control and turn it into a mathematically precise specification. What we do here in Bedrock AI Guardrails and agent core policy is do that as a conversation with the customer. Hey, you sent me this piece of natural language. It's not quite precise. It's got some internal inconsistencies. Let's talk together and figure out what exactly you mean, and then we can encode that into a program in Cedar, we can encode that into a program in Lean, and say mathematically precise exact statements about the behavior of that policy or specification. It's a super powerful tool. Another big area of investment is in

**[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=689s)** deterministic agent and tool policy. How do we take those those policies that you expressed in natural language and we formalized for you and apply them to the behavior of agents? We're doing this in multiple places in AWS and here's a few of them. In agent core policy you can apply them to these tool calls in the agent core gateway. In strands, which is our agent building framework, there's a cool feature called strands steering that allows you to encode policies as sets of pre- and post-conditions on tool calls, which is a great balance between giving models the flexibility to do the things they're good at and still guiding them in the direction of a correct outcome.

**[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=737s)** Just this week we open-sourced a tool called trusted remote execution that takes those auto-formalized policies written in Cedar and takes them out into the operational realm when we're running scripts to operate the cloud, those scripts and what they can do as they are built by agents are constrained using these formal Cedar policies where again we can allow the agents to be creative and adaptive while still having mathematically precise controls on the things they are able to do as they operate our cloud. It's the perfect balance for us. So, I think across the industry we need to have higher standards. I think we really need to internalize this idea that while the cool stuff is cool and

**[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=784s)** shiny and we should all be talking about it and getting excited about it, what is really going to make the impact is our is that defect rate. It's bringing the defect rate down, is getting people excited about being able to actually depend on agentic AI in their businesses and in their day-to-day lives. A couple of specific talks on that. I think we need more benchmarks that capture failure severity rather than just failure density. We should throw out things like pass at 10. And instead look at the failures and classify them in terms of how important they actually are to the customer and to the user of a generative AI. We need a more end-to-end view of a generative development success that

**[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQbzfC8jAXY&t=832s)** includes operational properties. Um it includes performance properties and improves cost properties, durability, availability, and so on. We need to develop, and this is kind of a research program, a deep understanding of the shape of these failures, so we can build tools, build models, and build processes to make them less impactful on our systems and our customers. And we need to take our worst days as seriously as our best ones. We need to build a real culture of understanding what doesn't work. And investing in fixing things and making them truly reliable.
